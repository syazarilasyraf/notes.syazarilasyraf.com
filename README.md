Just for sharing insightful notes on a variety of topics. These notes are organized into categories such as Learning, Efficiency, Tech, Self, Society, Creativity, and Location.

## About

It's built on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and uses the "No Style, Please" theme by [riggraz](https://github.com/riggraz/no-style-please).

## Features

One unique feature of this platform is the ability to post notes directly from the Obsidian.

I explained how i do this on this [post](https://syazarilasyraf.com/personalizing-your-website).

## Usage

No special setup is required as the platform is based on the "No Style, Please" theme.

## Future Plans

Currently, the focus is on posting new notes whenever time allows.

## Update

I no longer update new notes on this site. You can find all my latest notes at [feed.syazarilasyraf.com](https://github.com/syazarilasyraf/feed/syazarilasyraf.com).
